Do not insult or kidding me. I knew wikipedia is not censored but there is source   already. Quran 2:285 messengers of ALLAH have no distinction [[User:Weaktry|Weaktry]] ([[User talk:Weaktry|talk]]) 23:36, 29 September 2015 (UTC)

There is source already. primary source is Holy Quran. the article is strictly about islamic belief of prophet Muhammad(peace be upon him). and must obeyed the belief of Islam. [[User:Weaktry|Weaktry]] ([[User talk:Weaktry|talk]]) 23:38, 29 September 2015 (UTC)

:{{ec}} Where did I insult you?  The material you removed had even more sources that [[WP:NOR|original research]] based on [[WP:PRIMARY|exegesis of a primary source]] (something we do not encourage here).

In islamic belief, prophets of ALLAH have no distinction and all praise is only for Oneness of ALLAH The God. the article is strictly about prophet Muhammad in Islam. [[User:Weaktry|Weaktry]] ([[User talk:Weaktry|talk]]) 23:41, 29 September 2015 (UTC)

This is in regard to the ping I had left you earlier.

== Sorry for the lull in activity ==

Since arriving in China, I've had to do a fair amount of paperwork to ensure I can stay (and eat), and I'm kind of having to re-register my students.  The school gave me their info, but it's in Chinese (which I cannot yet read) and it's missing things that the school wouldn't need but I would (contact info, interests, etc).  Thankfully, I'm off for the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] and won't have classes until next Thursday.  Will leave my watchlist open while finishing the data entry (3.5 classes down, 4.5 to go), so I can at least occasionally swat at vandals whenever entering [[QQ]] and [[WeChat]] IDs starts to make my eyes bleed.

== I would recommend some sleep ==

Hi Ian! I've not had the pleasure of speaking with you before, but may I recommend that you get some sleep before answering more posts at the Teahouse. I've heard that doing an RfA takes its toll and you can get cranky towards the end. I also understand that you are probably sick and tired of fending off every company that want an article here, but sarcasm and snide comments should be kept out of the Teahouse. If you can't keep a civil tone and a level head right now you should not be editing. Please remember that should your RfA succeed.

== Again, thanks ==

Again, thanks everyone here and those who voted -- be it for me, or those who voiced legitimate concerns that I will need to address through my actions.  I will get on admining tomorrow, but for now I can only manage dinner and bed. [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson#top|talk]]) 11:03, 10 October 2015 (UTC)

== Congratulations ==

Nice to hear that! and I see many others here having the same feeling as me. I just meant to ask you tell me what you would not recommend in my contributions, as you said [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=685024003&oldid=685023857 here]? Thanks. [[User:Mhhossein|Mhhossein]] ([[User talk:Mhhossein|talk]]) 13:13, 10 October 2015 (UTC)
:{{ping|Mhhossein}} Don't worry, it was just the usual unideal stuff that can be found in the contributions of any editor who hangs around contentious topics long enough.  Nothing major enough that I can remember anything in particular -- I'd have to dig through again to point to something specific.  The most I can remember is seeing a few instances where it looked like you (and other people) were arguing against each other rather than seeking consensus by focusing on content.

When the full protection ends, will you restore indefinite semi-protection? --[[User:George Ho|George Ho]] ([[User talk:George Ho|talk]]) 00:50, 12 October 2015 (UTC)
:If I am on, yes.  Er... Actually, I'll be in the middle of teaching at this time in three days, so I may have to cut the full protection a few hours short.
:Course, if there's a consensus on the talk page before then, I could bring the full protection down earlier.  [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson#top|talk]]) 00:59, 12 October 2015 (UTC)

== Page protection ==

Hello, Ian, nice to see you getting right down to business at RFPP! Could I make one suggestion? Most of us add a brief edit summary showing what action we took - "semi one month", "3 days full", "salted", "declined", etc. Not required but can be useful to people scanning the history. Thanks for the help there and elsewhere! --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 00:55, 12 October 2015 (UTC)

== Page protection at Albertus Seba ==

Belated congratulations on the adminship! Anyways, I noticed you've been busy page-protecting, so could I trouble you for semi-protection on [[Albertus Seba]]?

:Part, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philip_Baker_%28obstetrician%29&diff=prev&oldid=685670342 this] is not really different from [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philip_Baker_%28obstetrician%29&diff=prev&oldid=685600877 this].  It is a revert, and there is no honest or reasonable argument to the contrary.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philip_Baker_%28obstetrician%29&diff=prev&oldid=685548671 Your claim here of reverting vandalism here] would have some semblance of merit if you weren't just [[WP:WL|using it as an excuse]] to edit war over the rest of the content changed.  If the problem was really the date, you'd just remove the word "July."  Obviously, that's not your problem with it.

== Your comment at RFPP ==

Hi Ian. You can take multiple admin actions and multiple types of admin actions to resolve a situation without being considered [[WP:INVOLVED]]. Blocking users and then declining protection is pretty standard. I've used the block, delete, and protect tools all for the same situation. As long as you're not involved with content as an editor, you're fine. BTW, you may want to look at the [[User:MusikAnimal/responseHelper]] script. --[[User:NeilN|<b style="color:navy">Neil<span style="color:red">N</span></b>]] <sup>[[User talk:NeilN|<i style="color:blue">talk to me</i>]]</sup> 11:36, 14 October 2015 (UTC)

== Changes on [[Fight the New Drug]] ==
Being quite inexperienced, I'm not even sure if this was the right place to talk to you, but I just wanted to know if we can come up with a consensus on the minor change on Fight the New Drug. Maybe using using the word "declaring that..." or even simply "saying that...". This isn't really important in and of itself, but I feel like it will set a tone for the article. I also wanted to ask you if we could change the wording of the article from "Mormons" to "members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints". I do not know if Wikipedia has an internal policy regarding this, but the Church has an official style guide released [http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/style-guide here]. If you could also let me know what the best method of reaching consensus in the future would be, that would be great.

:The article's talk page would probably be a better place.  "Saying" might be acceptable, but "declaring" still comes across like it's a proven fact and not just their claim.
:As for LDS or Mormon, it depends on the sources.  From a non-sectarian perspective, there are [[Mormons]] who are not necessarily members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  Should the sources clarify that the founding members all be members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, then we can go on ahead and be more specific that they are LDS members.  Should the sources use the more broad term "Mormon," then we follow suit.  One source says "LDS," two say "Mormon," but one of those two cites an LDS magazine for that information.  So, that change appears to be fine as well.  [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson#top|talk]]) 04:09, 27 October 2015 (UTC)
